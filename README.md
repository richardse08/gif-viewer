Gif Viewer

# TODO
- Page always starts showing 3 paginations instead of 5 when when there are 40 gifs total
- Previous/Next disable when you are at beginning/last page, but they need to not show at all
- Need to add error handling if Giphy refuses connection, etc.
- DS_store doesnt show up from show-all, but it CAN get called randomly when using random
- Page 1 only shows 9 gifs (must be related to ds_store)
